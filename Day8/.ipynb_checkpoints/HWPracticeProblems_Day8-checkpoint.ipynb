    "   - User Inputs: In so many of our examples thus far, we have started by asking for information. For example, in the Disneyland code we needed to know a person's age and how many days the were visiting. Normally, you don't want your user to have to open up your code to make these changes. User inputs let your code ask the user directly for data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - While Loops: These are just a different type of loop that allow your code to keep running a set of commands until a condition is met. Remember, For loops run for a specific set of runs based on your data. But what if you want to keep going until something is true about your data?"
